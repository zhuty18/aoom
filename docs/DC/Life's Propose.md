# Life's Propose

"What's it all about?" She asked.

I didn't answer, so she asked again. "What's it all about? You doing what you're doing, me doing what I'm doing... What's it all about?"

I didn't answer because I didn't know what needed to be said. I only started to know her tonight, and she was standing at the edge of roof, I didn't want her to step ahead.

I needed to find what she needed to hear.

Luckily, she's no completely stranger.

Alfred came in, with a... surprising gift. A thumb drive with a label "to Bruce".

"It's from Miss Hofftard." He said, "She dropped by a few minutes ago, said it was a peace offering."

Alfred told me exactly what happened.

She came here, gave him the thumb drive. Out of habit, he offered her a cup of tea.

She said with a smile, "Thank you, but maybe next time. That tea would be a lot more enjoyable when I'm not guilty of what I said last night. I wanted to say it wasn't me but it was. I just... Anyway, I want to make it up to him, so I brought this as a peace offering. Hopefully he would still want to be friends."

"Miss Hofftard, may I ask, why are you so nervous. Master Bruce didn't seem to be bothered by whatever happened last night."

She silenced for a while and said, "Bruce and I were never close, but I've always known he's a good man. If he saw someone standing by a cliff, his instinct is to pull them back. Even though that someone pulled a knife at him. I really appreciate that."

Then she cleared her throat, "Well, bye." and left.

What she had brought was... actually very useful.

"Why don't you smile? I mean for real." She asked.

Lying on the ground, bleeding out.

"Shut up and save strength." I commanded.

Neve Hofftard is not someone who take commands. She just laughed and said, "Just smile, be happy for me."

Exactly which part of this is could be happy for? "For what?"

"I'm living. I've never felt more alive. I found a propose of life."

"Which is?"

"I know it's not as important as yours, but it's a step for me, okay?"

"Okay."

"I want to have a cranberry vodka. When I survive this, I'm gonna take that drink. And you're buying." Her voice started lowering. It's not a good sign.

"Why would I buy you drinks?"

"Because we are friends!"

Bruce.

She moved her lips but she didn't say my name out loud.

And she winked at me.

Of course she will survive.

I'm not sure befriend with Neve Hofftard is a good idea for me. Though I have a lot of bad friends but this one just...

The first sign is Jason seems to like her. He tended to like people who can give me aneurysms. Tim, Talia, Roy, Rose...

Every Lantern who ever yelled at me.

The second sign is Alfred liked her, too. He tend to like people who can make my life more difficult. Dick, Clark, the league, the boarding...

Final sign would be now. Somehow she is... laughing... with Hal Jordan. Frankly I never believed that ex-boyfriend story, and one of the reasons was I did't believe she found men attractive. What I'm looking at just proved this theory. They kept distance, no physical attachment... I hate to admit, but Hal Jordan does have his charms. Yet they are not working.

Either they have nothing better to do or they are waiting for me.

Neve saw me, so I walked down to them.
