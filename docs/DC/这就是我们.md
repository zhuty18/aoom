# This is us

【Roy】

I used to push my luck, I used to fill my cup

Yeah, I used to be known for the dumb things

kory,donna

I used to chase the sun, I used to kiss and run

jade

All-nighters turned into nothings and I

I'm lucky every other lover got away

I'm lucky that my heart was always hard to break

I'm lucky when you came along I had a chance to take

'Cause it was just you and that was just me

And that was just the way that it used to be

And we were just kids back then tryna figure out what it was

No, it wasn't that bad but could've been better

If only back then we'd have been together

But it was just you and that was just me

Before we found love

Now this is us

【Jason】

All I really know is love ain't simple (Oh yeah, oh yeah)

It finds you all alone when you're unassembled

拉萨路池

Yeah, when you're in pieces and you feel like you're drowning

You don't wanna give nobody the power

That's when it gets in the cut

And that's when it stitches you up

'Cause it was just you and that was just me

And that was just the way that it used to be

And we were just kids back then tryna figure out what it was

No, it wasn't that bad but could've been better

If only back then we'd have been together

But it was just you and that was just me

Before we found love

Now this is us

This is us, this is us, this is us, yeah

This is trust, this is trust, this is trust, yeah

This is love, this is love, this is love, yeah (This is love, yeah)

I'm lucky every other lover got away

I'm lucky that my heart was always hard to break

I'm lucky when you came along I had a chance to take

'Cause it was just you and that was just me

And that was just the way that it used to be

And we were just kids back then tryna figure out what it was (Oh, it wasn't that bad)

No, it wasn't that bad but could've been better

If only back then we'd have been together

But it was just you and that was just me

Before we found love

Now this is us

This is us, this is us, this is us, yeah

This is trust, this is trust, this is trust, yeah

This is love, this is love, this is love, yeah (Yeah, yeah, this is love, yeah baby)

This is us, this is us, this is us, yeah (Yeah baby)

This is trust, this is trust, this is trust, yeah (Oh, baby)

This is love, this is love, this is love, yeah
